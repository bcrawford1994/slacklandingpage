I based my landing page on the content of the original Slack landing page with the structure of the CS 52 landing page displayed in the assignment instructions. While my use of flexboxes worked accurately and provided appropriate spacing between objects on the page, there was slight unnecessary movement on some objects when hovered upon that might take away from the overall aesthetic of the page.

Also, I forgot to create screen caps at the checkpoint in the lab while building the landing page, so I recreated the structure of the landing page that I originally had to take screen caps. I am unsure how to include them in the markdown file but will include them in the repository and the submission on canvas.
